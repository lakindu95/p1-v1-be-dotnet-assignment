## üìù Getting started

- Start the Postgres database with `docker-compose up -d` (the application is already configured properly, but if you want to connect to the db directly you can see the credentials in the `docker-compose.yml` file)
- You can now run the API project and everything should work. Upon start the application will run the migrations and seed data to the database.

### Run from CLI 

To run it from CLI, you should install dotnet CLI to your local machine
```
dotnet run --project ./API/API.csproj

To Exit
Ctrl + C
```

### Run from Visual Studio

```
1. Load the solution file sln
2. Build the project in Visual studio
3. Make sure the database is running on the docker as above step
4. Select the **API** as the start up project
5. Run the project (first time when running the project, a migration script will run and create the data needed)

Enjoy!
```
